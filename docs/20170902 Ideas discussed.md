The struts we wordered were quite heavy and probably not usable in the field. Hence, we propose the use of a lighter version of the struts. 

Our original idea was a pair of sensors on a bar, kept stable by a vertical strut as in the following diagram. However, the aluminium struts are quite heavy, so the user will get tired quite quickly with the proposed design.

However, we figured out that we can simplify the design by messuring the height of the sensor directly to the ground, instead of on the top of the cannopy. This will require the adition of a giroscope/angle sensor to make sure that the height is only messured when the strut is completly horizontally. This design will have a height sensor

To make the system as user friendly, we want to use the touch screen. We currently have a gen4-uLCD-32DT. This screen has a resolution of 240x320 with resistive touch panel
